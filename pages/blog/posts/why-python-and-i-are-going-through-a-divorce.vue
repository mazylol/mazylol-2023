        <p>
            I, like many other programmers, wrote my first Hello world in Python. For a good while I
            was having a blast. Python is what brought me into this world and I have to give it some
            commendation for that. However, over time, I have drifted away from Python. Here's why.
        </p>
        <h2>Simplicity</h2>
        <p>
            Syntactically, Python is very simple. This is a great thing for new programmers...or is
            it? While being easy to understand is important Python's strangeness makes understanding
            other languages a bit more difficult. It is almost like Python gives you training
            wheels, but never let's you take a leap of faith and gain the full power of riding two
            wheeled. For example Python's Dynamic Typing got me accustomed to making variables with
            little to no thought. Then when I tried languages like Rust and C I was very confused by
            the idea of static typing.
        </p>
        <h2>Speed</h2>
        <p>
            Python is an interpreted language. What does this mean? An interpreter reads code line
            by line. It translates your human understandable code to stuff that a computer can
            actually do something with. Notice how I said line by line. The Python interpreter
            executes code one line at a time. Consider this example. Here I have Python code that
            will solve the tower of hanoi. It does it, cool. Now let's compare it to the exact same
            problem, but solved using C. The C version was over two times faster! Let's look at this
            another way. Say we are trying to do c = a + b. In C, under the hood it would be loading
            the integer from location a, then again for location b. It would do the addition and
            store the value into location C. Meanwhile in Python it would have to load the object
            from location a, then from location b. Find the add method in object a, perform type
            checks and do the proper type casting for object b. Throw an exception if b does not
            have an appropriate representation. Extract the integer value from object a, then again
            for object b. Do the addition, allocate new memory, wrap the value in a new object. So
            basically Python issues a few hundred CPU commands for C's 4.
        </p>
        <h2>Errors</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the dynamic typing of Python, many errors only show up at runtime. This is
            inefficient and annoying. Even more annoying is the content of the errors themself.
            Python errors are very hard to decipher. They are complex and do not do a good job of
            telling you what is wrong. This is the reason that I like Rust so much. Rust errors are
            very, very easy to understand, plus a lot of the time the compiler will almost tell you
            what you need to do to fix it.
        </p>
        <h2>Package Management</h2>
        <p>
            Installing a Python package with PIP can be a real nightmare. For example, you try to
            install a package and you get `permission denied`, you try to install it with sudo and
            it messes with the environment variables on your system. Plus I always find that PIP has
            errors that are a hassle to reconcile when all I want to do is whip up the odd script.
        </p>
        <h2>Readability</h2>
        <p>
            This is probably the biggest thing that makes Python a nightmare for me. The code is
            basically spaghetti. Who thought that tabs instead of curly braces is a good idea?
            Having functionality be determined by code formatting is preposterous. It makes seeing
            where functions end and where if statements begin.
        </p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            In the end Python will always have a place rooted in my heart for being the language
            that got my foot in the door to programming. But now that I have matured and discovered
            better tools I will not be using it for anything other than quick scripting.
